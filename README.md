Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project I was given the code for a treasure hunt game in which I needed to complete the code for the Q-Training Algorithm within the .py file. I was given three files, the GameExperience.py file, the TreasureMaze.py file, and finally the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb file that I needed to create code in. The section I worked on specifially was within the def qtrain() function in which I needed to create the Q-learning implementation so that there was a 100% win rate achieved. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists essentially use technology to solve problems, they use data science and programming skills in order to improve computer systems, software and create or improve algorithms. Computer scientists are necessary in order to push technology forward and use critical thinking with technology to solve new problems created every day. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist I look into what needs to be achieved by the program and what obstacles are in the way of doing so. If I am making something for an end user, I first need to understand what their requirements are and make sure that these requirements are clear and achievable. If the problem is something I am doing myself or something that needs to be fixed in say a work environment I need to understand what the issues are with the problem. Is the program operable in anyway? What bugs are taking place? 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I owe the end users (regardless if its one person or many or an organization) the responsibility to create software in order to achieve their wants. To create software that is functional and safe to use that will operate efficently and protect any valuable data should it be needed. Programs need to protect any valuable data to prevent it from being accessed by hackers that wish to obtain such valuable data.
